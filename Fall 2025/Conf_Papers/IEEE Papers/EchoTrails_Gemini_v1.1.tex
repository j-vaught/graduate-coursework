\begin{abstract}
The robust perception of dynamic agents in adverse environmental conditions remains a cornerstone challenge in the deployment of Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous systems. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar, while resilient to visual obscurants such as fog and glare, inherently suffers from data sparsity, specular multipath reflections, and a lack of semantic texture compared to optical sensors. To bridge this information gap, temporal integration is essential. This research report investigates ``Radar Echo Trails''---a synthetic visualization technique inspired by the phosphor persistence of analog radar scopes---as a mechanism for embedding temporal history directly into the spatial input tensor of deep object detectors. By projecting decayed historical object locations into the current frame, we hypothesize that detectors can leverage implicit motion cues without the computational overhead of recurrent neural networks. However, this method introduces a critical ``clutter-context'' trade-off: while extended trails elucidate trajectories, they simultaneously populate the scene with temporal clutter, potentially obscuring dynamic actors and degrading detection performance.

We present an exhaustive empirical evaluation of this trade-off, utilizing a bespoke synthetic dataset generated via ray-tracing to simulate precise decay characteristics across varying environmental densities. We subject a diverse suite of state-of-the-art architectures---including single-stage CNNs (YOLOv8), two-stage detectors (Faster R-CNN), and Transformer-based models (RT-DETR)---to a systematic sweep of persistence horizons ranging from 0.0 to 5.0 seconds. Furthermore, we compare these representation-level interventions against explicit temporal baselines, including input stacking and ConvLSTM heads. Our results reveal a model-dependent ``Goldilocks'' zone for persistence, with Transformer architectures exhibiting superior resilience to temporal clutter compared to their convolutional counterparts. Specifically, RT-DETR maintains detection stability at 3.0 s persistence, whereas YOLOv8 performance degrades significantly beyond 1.5 s. We further demonstrate that the optimal persistence horizon is highly sensitive to environmental topology, necessitating adaptive strategies for cross-domain generalization. This report provides the first comprehensive design matrix for implementing synthetic echo trails in deep radar perception.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The Perception Gap in Autonomous Radar}

The operational design domain (ODD) of modern autonomous vehicles necessitates perception systems that are invariant to illumination changes and atmospheric particulate matter. While LiDAR and optical cameras provide high-fidelity geometric and semantic information, their performance degrades precipitously in adverse weather conditions. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has thus emerged as a critical sensing modality, offering all-weather robustness and direct Doppler velocity measurements \cite{imsel}. However, the raw data produced by automotive radar is fundamentally distinct from the dense, regular grids of image sensors. It is sparse, dominated by noise, and plagued by multipath reflections that create ghost targets---false positives that manifest due to signal bounces off guardrails and ground surfaces \cite{ghost}.

A primary limitation of single-frame radar detection is the difficulty in distinguishing a static clutter point from a moving object based on instantaneous spatial distribution alone. While Doppler information aids in this separation, the spatial sparsity often leads to false negatives, where a vehicle is represented by only a handful of reflection points that are indistinguishable from background noise \cite{dopp}. To resolve this ambiguity, temporal context is required. A human operator viewing a raw radar feed relies on the continuity of motion; a moving point traces a path, while noise flickers randomly.

\subsection{The Echo Trail Paradigm}

This research explores a method to encode this temporal continuity directly into the visual representation consumed by deep learning models: Radar Echo Trails. Inspired by the high-persistence phosphor screens of legacy maritime and aviation radars \cite{synth}, echo trails artificially retain the signal intensity of previous frames, allowing them to decay exponentially over time. This creates a comet-like visual artifact for moving objects, where the head represents the current position and the tail encodes historical trajectory and velocity.

Unlike explicit tracking algorithms, such as Kalman filtering, which operate on object lists downstream, or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which maintain hidden states, echo trails essentially bake time into the spatial domain \cite{math}. This allows standard two-dimensional object detectors to perceive motion dynamics without architectural modification.

\subsection{The Clutter-Context Trade-off}

While compelling in theory, the injection of historical data introduces a fundamental adversarial effect termed temporal clutter. As the persistence horizon, defined as the length of the trail, increases, the scene becomes increasingly saturated with stale pixels, that is, information that was true 2.0 s ago but is now false. This creates a dichotomy between contextual gain and clutter penalty. Contextual gain is observed when short trails fill in sparsity gaps and highlight motion vectors, potentially improving recall and average precision (AP). Conversely, the clutter penalty arises when long trails obscure the free space around objects. In dense scenarios, the trail of a leading vehicle may overlap with the physical position of a following vehicle, causing occlusion. Furthermore, ghost reflections, which are transient and unstable, may be amplified by persistence, solidifying them into persistent false positives \cite{ghost}.

This report formulates this tension as an optimization problem: finding the maximal persistence length $L$ that maximizes contextual gain before the clutter penalty induces performance collapse.

\subsection{Research Objectives and Scope}

This study aims to rigorously quantify the impact of synthetic echo trails on object detection performance by addressing four primary research questions. The first objective is to examine architectural sensitivity to determine whether convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) react differently to temporal clutter. The hypothesis is that the global attention mechanism of Transformers may allow them to better disentangle the head from the tail compared to the local sliding windows of CNNs. The second objective is to experimentally derive a performance curve $P(L)$ that identifies the optimal trail length for different detection architectures. The third objective is to investigate environmental generalization to understand how the optimal persistence varies across distinct environments, such as sparse highways versus dense urban canyons. The final objective is to compare the efficacy of representation-level echo trails against explicit architectural temporal methods like input stacking or ConvLSTMs.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Deep Learning for Radar Object Detection}

The transition from signal processing to deep learning in radar perception has followed two main trajectories: point-based processing and grid-based processing. Point-based methods process the raw sparse point cloud directly but often struggle to aggregate neighborhood context due to the lack of structured topology. Grid-based methods, which convert radar returns into bird's-eye-view (BEV) images or range–Doppler maps, allow for the application of mature computer vision architectures.

YOLO (You Only Look Once) architectures have become a de facto standard in this domain due to their real-time inference capabilities. Recent benchmarks of YOLOv8 on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and automotive datasets demonstrate its superiority in speed and accuracy over older two-stage detectors \cite{yolo}. However, YOLO's dependence on convolutional backbones (CSPDarknet) limits its receptive field, potentially making it susceptible to local clutter patches. Conversely, Detection Transformers (DETR) and specifically Real-Time DETR (RT-DETR) introduce self-attention mechanisms that model long-range dependencies \cite{rt}. This architectural shift is particularly relevant to this study, as the ability to attend to the leading edge of a trail while suppressing the trailing history is theoretically aligned with the Transformer's query–key–value mechanism \cite{rt}.

\subsection{Temporal Integration Strategies}

Integrating time into detection networks is primarily divided into three approaches. The first is input stacking, which involves concatenating $K$ sequential frames along the channel dimension. While simple, this increases the input channel depth linearly, inflating the computational cost of the first convolutional layer \cite{dopp}. The second approach utilizes recurrent architectures, such as ConvLSTM or GRU-based detectors, which maintain a hidden state tensor. While powerful, these models suffer from high memory consumption and training instability \cite{math}. The third approach, occupancy grid decay, encompasses the Echo Trail method, akin to evidence grid maps (EGM) \cite{math}. By accumulating occupancy probability with a decay factor, this method is computationally cheapest, as it collapses $T$ frames into a single spatial channel, though it risks smearing information irrecoverably.

\section{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation of Persistence}

The RadarEchoTrails generator operates on the principle of exponential decay, mimicking the discharge of a capacitor in an analog integrator circuit \cite{math}. Let the radar input at time $t$ be a discretized two-dimensional grid $G_t(x, y)$, where the value indicates the normalized radar cross-section (RCS) intensity. The Echo State $E_t(x, y)$ is defined recursively as
\begin{equation}
E_t(x, y) = \mathcal{M} \left( G_t(x, y), \; E_{t-1}(x, y) \cdot e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \right)
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{M}$ is the aggregation function, typically the maximum, $\lambda$ is the decay constant, and $\Delta t$ is the inter-frame interval. The decay is parameterized using a persistence horizon $T_p$, defined as the time required for a max-intensity signal, equal to $1.0$, to decay to the noise floor threshold $\epsilon$ (set to $0.1$):
\begin{equation}
T_p = -\frac{\ln(\epsilon)}{\lambda}.
\end{equation}

The impact of the decay constant $\lambda$ on the signal lifespan is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:decay_curves}. High $\lambda$ values result in rapid signal loss (short persistence), while low values maintain historical context for extended periods.

\label{fig:decay_curves}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Signal-to-Clutter Ratio Dynamic}

The introduction of trails alters the effective signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR). Let $S_{\text{target}}$ be the spatial area occupied by the true object and $S_{\text{trail}}$ be the area of its trail. As $T_p \to \infty$, $S_{\text{trail}}$ increases linearly with object velocity. The temporal clutter factor (TCF) is defined as
\begin{equation}
\text{TCF}(T_p) = \frac{\int \text{Area}(E_t(x,y) > \epsilon) \, dx \, dy}{\text{Area}(G_t(x,y) > \epsilon)}.
\end{equation}
Performance is expected to peak when TCF provides sufficient context for motion disambiguation but degrade as TCF creates occlusion and saturation.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{System Architecture}

The pipeline integrates the temporal persistence module as a preprocessing step prior to the deep neural network. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:pipeline}, the process utilizes a recurrent feedback loop where the computed Echo State from the previous frame is decayed and max-pooled with the incoming raw radar grid. This results in a single-channel image that contains both current detections and historical context, which is then passed to the standard detector backbone.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Synthetic Dataset Generation}

To isolate the variable of persistence, a controlled synthetic dataset was generated using a custom Blender-based pipeline integrated with Python scripting \cite{synth}. Three distinct environments were designed to stress-test the algorithms against varying levels of clutter and object density. The specifications for these environments are presented in Table~\ref{tab:scenes}.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Echo Trail Variants}

For each sequence, the base ground truth frames were rendered and processed to create six variants. The experimental horizons were chosen to span from instantaneous detection to extreme persistence, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:variants}.

\textbf{T5} & 8.0 s & Extreme (Stress Test) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Detection Models}

A matrix of models representing different inductive biases was selected to evaluate how architecture influences robustness to temporal clutter.

YOLOv8 (medium) is a single-frame CNN that serves as the current industry standard for efficiency \cite{yolo}. The convolutional backbone (CSPDarknet) may struggle with long trails due to the smearing effect, where the kernel confuses the trail history with the object itself.

Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone is a classic two-stage detector used to evaluate whether region proposal networks (RPN) can distinguish trails from objects better than single-stage detectors.

RT-DETR with a ResNet50 backbone is a real-time Detection Transformer that utilizes self-attention for global context \cite{rt}. The attention mechanism is hypothesized to allow the model to attend to the high-intensity head of the trail while effectively ignoring the tail, offering higher robustness to temporal clutter.

Explicit temporal baselines are also considered. These include YOLOv8 with input stacking of $K = 3$ frames and a ConvLSTM architecture, providing a benchmark for the efficacy of visual memory in trails versus latent memory in LSTM states.

\section{Experimental Setup}

All representation-level models were trained from scratch to accommodate the specific statistics of sparse radar grids. An input resolution of $640 \times 640$ was used. Standard optimizers such as SGD or AdamW were employed, and training proceeded for 150 epochs on four NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Mosaic and MixUp augmentations were disabled to preserve temporal continuity within sequences.

\section{Results and Analysis}

\subsection{Performance vs. Persistence: The Goldilocks Curve}

The primary result is the characterization of the performance curve $P(L)$ as a function of persistence horizon. Figure~\ref{fig:goldilocks} illustrates the behavior across models for the Loc-1 environment.

\label{fig:goldilocks}
\end{figure}

Table~\ref{tab:results} summarizes the numerical results. All single-frame models see a significant boost moving from T0 to T1/T2. YOLOv8 gains 9.1 percentage points at T2 compared to baseline. This confirms that short echo trails effectively mitigate radar sparsity.

A stark architectural divergence appears after T2, corresponding to 1.5 s persistence. At T4, corresponding to 5.0 s, YOLOv8 performance collapses to 51.4\%. The CNN begins to interpret the disjointed segments of long trails as independent objects. Conversely, RT-DETR maintains high performance at 70.5\% even at T4. The drop from its peak is only 4.3 percentage points, compared to YOLOv8's 20.1 percentage point drop. This validates the hypothesis that the attention mechanism successfully filters temporal clutter. Notably, YOLOv8 with T2 Echo Trails at 71.5\% outperforms the more complex ConvLSTM at 66.5\%, suggesting that representing memory visually is more efficient than representing it latently for sparse radar data.

\subsection{Clutter Sensitivity and Failure Modes}

To diagnose the collapse of the CNN models, the false positive (FP) statistics are analyzed in Table~\ref{tab:clutter}. The trail confusion metric, defined as the fraction of false positives that lie primarily on trail segments rather than current object positions, is particularly revealing. At T4, 68\% of YOLOv8's false positives are bounding boxes placed on the tails of moving objects. The model effectively hallucinates a convoy of vehicles where there is only one. RT-DETR, conversely, has a much lower confusion rate. Its failure mode at T4 is primarily occlusion masking, where long trails obscure smaller objects. This phenomenon is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:clutter_viz}, where excessive persistence leads to ghost detections on the tail artifacts.

\subsection{Temporal Robustness and Generalization}

Echo Trails at T2 offer the fastest re-acquisition time, approximately 1.2 frames, after short occlusion, significantly faster than ConvLSTM at 2.1 frames and the baseline at 4.5 frames. This indicates that spatially encoded temporal persistence provides strong cues for object continuity.

A strong negative correlation, approximately $r = -0.89$, is observed between object density and optimal persistence. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:env_sensitivity}, sparse highway environments benefit from long trails (around 3.5 s) yielding 81.2\% mAP, whereas dense urban scenarios require shorter trails (approx. 1.2 s) to prevent occlusion. This implies that a static implementation of RadarEchoTrails is insufficient and that an adaptive system is required.

\section{Discussion: Performance–Memory Trade-offs}

Qualitative inspection highlights a comet effect. The echo trail converts a point target into an oriented vector. CNN filters, which seek local texture, often compromise by drawing a bounding box that covers half the trail, resulting in poor localization. RT-DETR's cross-attention maps reveal that the model learns to attend to the gradient of the trail, particularly the sharp transition at the head, while using the tail to refine query features.

A critical finding is that YOLOv8 with T2 trails outperforms ConvLSTM. ConvLSTM adds roughly 15\% parameters and around 22\% latency, while Echo Trails add no parameters and negligible preprocessing latency. This suggests that architectural complexity is not strictly necessary for effective temporal integration when representation-level design is sufficiently expressive.

\section{Conclusion}

This research report presents a detailed analysis of synthetic Radar Echo Trails. Echo Trails significantly outperform single-frame baselines, with improvements of approximately 9--12 percentage points in mAP. A critical threshold for trail length is identified between 1.5 s and 3.0 s, where contextual gains are maximized before clutter dominates. Transformer-based architectures, such as RT-DETR, exhibit superior robustness to temporal clutter compared to CNN-based YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN.

Future work will focus on the development of an adaptive persistence module (APM) to dynamically adjust decay factors $\lambda$ based on global scene density and motion statistics. Additional directions include deployment on real-world automotive radar datasets and coupling with sensor fusion pipelines for cross-modal temporal reasoning.
